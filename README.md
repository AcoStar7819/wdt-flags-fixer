# [WDT](https://wowdev.wiki/WDT#MPHD_chunk) flags fixer

Removes two flags (0x100 and 0x8000) from wdt that enable the usage of LOD landscape files. After this you can don't worry about correct updating lod files, but your render distance may decrease.

## Usage
- Download latest compiled release
- Drag and drop your wdt file to "WDT flags fixer.exe"
